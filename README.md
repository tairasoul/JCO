# JCO
~~A remake of rco-but-it-uses-different-fflags in NodeJS, due to the original RCO2 being compromised.~~ Maybe not compromised. Not sure, [this got changed though](https://cw.rfo.sh/)

In progress. Need to setup installer and actual settings moving.

This will likely not be maintained due to the fork of RCO I made being safe (not using any URL's from l8x)

If any of that changes, this will be maintained.

# todo

- figure out where to get fvars from
  - fvars will be gettable from a local json file, if you need any go [here](https://github.com/fheahdythdr/rco-fflags)

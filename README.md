# Development of this project is on halt until I get the motivation to work on this again.

# JCO

JCO ~~is~~ was a remake of RCO in NodeJS.

It is now a project I made to temporarily serve as a early windows release using [RFO](https://dc.rfo.sh/)'s [JS api](https://github.com/rbxflags/js-api).

In progress.

Hide the terminal by pressing it's tray icon in the bottom right.

# todo

- implement custom FFlags in a user-friendly manner

- make it so it'll delete 2nd last line after awnsering as to not fill up the entire console with questions

- options relating to changing some fflag options should display what you currently have selected

# JCO

JCO ~~is~~ was a remake of RCO in NodeJS.

It is now a project I made to temporarily serve as a early windows release using RFO's JS api.

In progress.

Hide the terminal by pressing it's tray icon in the bottom right.

# todo

- implement custom FFlags in a user-friendly manner

- make it so it'll delete 2nd last line after awnsering as to not fill up the entire console with questions

- options relating to changing some fflag options should display what you currently have selected

# JCO
A remake of rco-but-it-uses-different-fflags in NodeJS, due to the original RCO2 being compromised.

In progress. Need to setup installer and actual settings moving.

# todo

- figure out where to get fvars from
  - do i give the user pre-determined fvars, or do i make it so the user inputs all the fvars they want
    - i will temporarily make it user-defined fvars until i figure out how to either [parse fvars from here](https://github.com/rbxflags/Flags) or get my own fvar list
